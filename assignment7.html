    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        For my final project, I'd like to make a <span style="font-style: italic"> mini tabletop bowling game</span>!
        <br>
        <br>
        I thought that this would be a fun thing to make. I'll have a portable game that can fit into my backpack
        when finished and designing the storage case will give me a good foundation if I ever want to make more
        mini-sized versions of games in the future.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'll use <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold"> Rhino</span> to model a
        <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold"> 3D-printed</span> storage case
        that converts into a bowling alley and model the 3D printed
        molds for my <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold"> silicone molds</span> that will be used to
        <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold"> cast</span> the bowling ball and pins.
        I'll utilize <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold"> Grasshopper</span> to
        help model
        and adjust the size of the bowling ball and pins, as well as make a 3D printed organizer for the inside of the
        storage case to hold the bowling ball and pins so they don't move around when stored or when transporting.
        <br>
        <br>
        The sketch below showcases how the 3D-printed bowling alley converts into a storage case for the game.

    <h2>Rendering</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I did a simple rendering to showcase what the final result may look like. On the left, there's a rendering
        of the bowling alley assembled with the bowling ball and pins in place. The right is a view of how the objects
        will be stored inside the 3D printed container (with the top off).

    <h2>Task Breakdown</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Techniques Applied</span>
        <br>
        Rhino, Grasshopper, Slicing, 3D Printing, Silicone Molds, Casting
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">1. Modeling the 3D Printed Storage Case</span>
        <br>
        Using Rhino, I'll model the storage case that converts into a bowling alley. The storage
        case is composed of three parts: the main body, the half of the alley that doubles as the
        containers top, and the closing wall. I'll utilize Grasshopper to ensure that the notches
        on the sides of the connecting edges align and are equally spaced apart from each other.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">2. Printing the Storage Case</span>
        <br>
        Once the storage case is modeled, I'll print all three pieces.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">3. Modeling the Mold for the Silicone Molds</span>
        <br>
        I'll be using silicone molds to cast the bowling ball and pins. The bowling ball will be
        cast in a 2-part silicone mold, and the pins will be cast in a single silicone mold.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">3 part 2. Modeling the Organizer with Grasshopper</span>
        <br>
        As I'm modeling the molds for the silicone molds, I'll utilize Grasshopper to
        additionally model an organizer for the casted objects. This organizer will fit into the storage box.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">4. Print the Molds for the Silicone Molds</span>
        <br>
        I'll then print the molds for the silicone molds.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">5. Printing the Organizer</span>
        <br>
        Once the printed molds for the silicone molds is finished, I'll start printing the organizer. This
        will be my last 3D printed component.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">6. Pouring the Silicone</span>
        <br>
        Once the molds for the molds are done printing, I set up my work station to safely mix and pour
        the Oommoo 30 silicone into the molds. I'll let the molds cure for at least 6 hours or overnight.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">7. Removing the Silicone Molds</span>
        <br>
        In my last silicone mold project, I had to destroy the 3D printed mold to remove the silicone mold. I'm
        hoping that won't be the case again this time, but if I need to use the hammer again, it's a nice way to
        release stress.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">8. Casting the Bowling Ball and Pins</span>
        <br>
        I'll then cast the bowling ball and pins with the alternative plaster I used to produce my Kirbys.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">9. Finishing Touches</span>
        <br>
        Once the casts are completed, I'll paint them and then spray the paint with a glossy seal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">10. Assembly and Documentation</span>
        <br>
        All the pieces will be finished at this point, so all there is left is assembly and documentation.
    </p>
