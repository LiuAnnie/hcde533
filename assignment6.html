    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Fabricate a 2-part silicone mold and use the mold to cast 4 identical parts.
    </p>

    <h2>Last Week</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Last week, I decided to make a 2-part silicone mold to produce Kirby (master part was found on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1913526"
           style="color: deeppink">Thingiverse</a>
        ). Using Rhino (and with Junchao's help),
        I was able to model and 3D print the molds for my silicone molds. The files for the 3D printed molds can be
        found
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LiuAnnie/hcde533/tree/main/A5-Mold"

    <h2>Making the Silicone Molds</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        This week, I made the silicone molds! Before mixing the silicone, I needed to prepare my work station!
        I covered my work surface with a sheet of cardboard and gathered a disposable container (to catch any liquids),
        clear plastic cups, and a plastic knife to mix the silicone with. Using Smooth-On's Oomoo 30, I mixed equal
        parts A and B in clear plastic cups until the entire mix was one color. Once the silicone was well mixed, I
        poured the
        lavender-colored mix into the mold for kirby's top half. I then repeated this same process to fill the 3D
        printed mold for kirby's bottom half. After I poured each mold, I tapped the mold several times to try and get
        any air
        bubbles I could out. Once both molds were poured, I let the silicone cure overnight (cure for at least 6
        hours).

    <h2>Removing the Silicone Molds</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The next morning, I woke up to my cured silicone molds! It was time to remove the silicone molds from the 3D
        printed
        mold. I began by taking a knife along the edges of the mold to detach it from the sides of the 3d print. I then
        tried
        to tap the silicone mold out by tapping the bottom, hoping that it would fall out. It didn't fall out...So I
        thought
        about other ways to remove it. I worried that prying the silicone mold out from the side would damage or rip the
        mold
        so I didn't want to do that. I remembered that last week Junchao had told me that I may need to destroy my mold
        to get
        the silicone mold out. So I took my two-part mold outside, grabbed a hammer, and went at it. I hammered the
        bottom and
        the sides of the 3D print, until I could rip apart the four walls surrounding the mold. Then I peeled the
        remaining piece
        from the bottom. That did it! My silicone mold was intact, and I repeated this process for the second half. I
        did the
        bottom half of Kirby next, and that silicone mold was a bit more difficult to remove. Kirby's feet were stuck so
        the silicone
        mold ripped a bit when I finally removed the 3D printed part. However, it was okay! The silicone bit didn't rip
        off, so it
        flexed back into its spot.

        The 2-part silicone mold fits! The keys align and keep the 2 parts from shifting.

    <h2>Casting</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        It's time to cast! To prepare my workstation, I laid down some sheets of foil.
        I used
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XW9ML9P/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1TCCTWJEEAWK7&psc=1"
           style="color: deeppink">this</a>
        plaster alternative. The mix was three parts cast material and one part water. I mixed this in plastic
        cups. It started curing pretty quickly so I had to pour the cast material into the mold right after mixing.
        My first cast was a bit difficult to fill, because it was hardening and blocking the pouring hole. I tapped
        the mold several times which allowed the casting material to fall into the mold. Luckily, I was able fill the
        entire mold. I waited a full 45 minutes for the cast to cure and then removed it from the mold! It turned out
        really well!

    <p style="width: 80%">
        Kirby is so cute!! After the first cast, I learned that I needed to mix the cast material quickly, pour the material
        in while it's still liquid-y, and tap the mold to get air bubbles out (this lets the material fall further into the mold).
        I also recommend doing this process in a well ventilated area. I did the first cast in a bedroom with a fan turned on, but
        I don't think that was good enough and I got a headache. I repeated the process to make more casts, but did this in the
        kitchen with a window open.

    <h2>Making My Kirby Army</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I made a total of 6 Kirby casts. I decided to paint 2 of them! I'm very happy with my Kirby army. The Kirbys bring me
        great joy.
