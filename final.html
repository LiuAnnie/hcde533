    <h1>Mini Tabletop Bowling Game</h1>
    <p style="width: 80%; padding-bottom: 75px">
        For my final project, I'm made a<span style="font-style: italic"> mini tabletop bowling game</span>!
        <br>
        <br>
        The game is packaged in a 3D-printed box that converts into a bowling alley. The includes 2 sets of bowling
        pins,
        3 bowling balls, and 1 set of bowling blocks, which are packaged in a storage
        container that fits inside the box. It fits easily into a backpack so you can take it anywhere.
        <br>
        <br>
        Game Box Dimensions: 6" x 4" x 2"
        <br> Approx~ 14 oz.
        <br>
        <br>
        Project Duration: 2 Weeks

    <h2>Ways to Play</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        There are 2 ways that I enjoy playing the game, but you may find more ways to enjoy it!
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Set up the bowling alley and knock over as many pins as you can.

    <p style="width: 80%">
        I utilized the following tools and techniques to accomplish my project: Rhino, Grasshopper,
        Slicing, 3D Printing, Silicone Molds, and Casting. See my
        <a target="_blank" href="assignment7.html"
           style="color: deeppink">
            final project proposal
        </a>
        to view the plan!
        <br>
        <br>
        I dedicated more time to this project than planned during the first week, so I was 90% finished
        with the project in the first 7 days. After testing the experience, I realized there was several
        improvements that I could make so the second week was dedicated to improvements.
    </p>

    <h2>Modeling</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I modeled a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">total of 11 parts, not including multiple versions and test
            print models of the same part.</span>
        I started by modeling the 3-part box that converts into a bowling alley. I used Grasshopper to
        aid the modeling process (learned how to extrude, loft, and create a surface from a curve)! To help
        future me understand what the Grasshopper definition does, I made notes to remind myself what the different
        areas of the definition do: whether something is solely a reference or if I should bake it.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/grasshopperOverview.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/grasshopperBox.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/grasshopperSlidingLid.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/grasshopperStorage.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/grasshopperLargeStorage.PNG" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I used Grasshopper to help model 2/3 of the box components. I modeled the last piece, the clip, in Rhino.
        After the modeling for the box was done, started printing! I then continued modeling by making the molds
        for my silicone molds. I made three silicone molds in total: 15mm diameter sphere, 25 mm diameter sphere,
        and bowling pins. The last thing I needed to model was a storage case for the bowling pins and balls. I used
        Grasshopper to help model part of it, and after baking, did the rest in Rhino. I later ended up modeling a
        larger version of the storage box and more bowling pins.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are all the models (including the additional models from second week improvements)!
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/modelsFinal.PNG" width="80%">

    <h2>Printing</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I did all prints with white PLA filament! I did a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">total of 19 prints, including test prints.</span>
        I started off by printing the box (9h13m @ low quality).
        I then did a test print (41m @ low quality) of the sliding lid to test the fit with the box. I only
        printed the portion of the sliding lid that I needed, as seen below. This piece would allow me to
        check how well the lid snaps with and slides into the box.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/slideTest.PNG" width="80%">

    <p style="width: 80%">
        The printed test piece slided and snapped well! I continued by printing the full sliding lid (3h26m @ low
        quality).
        <br>
        <br>
        Afterwards, I printed the clip/closing piece for the box. I didn't do any test prints for this piece and
        printed
        the full part (1h34m @ low quality). This part fit poorly with the other 2 box parts, because it was too loose.
        I went back into Rhino to adjust the size of the notches to fit better, and then printed the piece again (1h35m
        @ low quality). This piece ended up being too tight. I took a box cutter and shaved the sides of the print that
        weren't fitting, until the piece could snap into the other 2 box pieces. That wasn't ideal, but it worked.
        <br>
        <br>
        I moved on to printing the molds-for-molds. I started by printing the molds for the larger sphere (6h43m @
        dynamic
        quality). As I went on to print the molds for the smaller sphere, I mistakenly printed a second set of molds for
        the larger sphere (another 6h43m @ dynamic quality). Paying more attention, I later printed the molds for the
        small sphere (2h @ dynamic quality) and the mold for the bowling pins (4h27m @ low quality).
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, I printed the storage box and lid (7h1m @ low quality) for the bowling balls and initial pins. I wanted
        the
        lid to fit more snug so I adjusted the Rhino model and printed again (2h14m @ low quality).
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the final prints!

    <h2>Molds</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Then it was time to make the silicone molds for the bowling balls and pins! I made 2
        2-part silicone molds to make different sized bowling balls and a one-part silicone
        mold to make the bowling pins.
        <br>
        <br>
        Similar to what I did in the molds and casting project, I prepared my workstation by
        covering the table surface, mixed equal parts of part A and part B together for at least
        3 minutes until the entire mixture was a lavender color, and poured the silicone in.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/molds.jpg" width="80%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/silicone_setup.jpg" width="40%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/poured.jpg" width="40%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I let the molds cure for 7 hours (at least 6) before removing them. Here are my silicone
        molds!
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/moldsOut.jpg" width="80%">


    <h2>Casting</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Afterwards, I began casting the bowling balls and pins. When I was modeling, I wanted to
        make sure that the pouring hole was large enough, but later on realized that I could have
        made it smaller. I used a box cutter to shave off the excess cast material to achieve the
        spherical shape for the bowling balls.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/casting.jpg" width="40%">
    <img src="FinalProject/images/scrape.jpg" width="40%">

    <h2>Finishes</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        After casting, I painted the bowling pins and balls! At this point, I was almost done with
        everything listed on my proposal.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/before.jpg" width="80%">

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I then tested the bowling experience, but it wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped. The casted
        bowling pins didn't disperse well and would lean against each other when knocked over.
    </p>
    <img src="FinalProject/images/beforeFail.gif" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px">
        disappointment <span style="font-style: normal">😐</span>
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I remembered that when I was modeling the pins, I had 3D printed them to gauge different bowling
        pin sizes on the alley. The 3D-printed pins dispersed much better and made a satisfying sound. I
        had one more week to work on the project, so I decided that week 2 would be for improvements!
    </p>

    <h2>Second Week Improvements</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        During the second week, I:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        -Remodeled and printed the box's clip.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: normal">Remember when the clip was too tight and I used
        a box cutter to shave the print until it fit? I went back into Rhino, remodeled the clip, printed it
         (1h35 @ low quality),and now it fits!</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -Remodeled and printed the smaller storage container's lid.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: normal">Before deciding on modeling a new, larger storage container, I worked
        on improving the previous storage container's lid so it had a better fit. It took 3 tries (modeling +
        printing) to get a fit I was happy with.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        -Modeled and printed 2 sets of bowling pins.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: normal">Since I was 3D-printing my pins now, I decided to go for a more
        traditional bowling pin shape. I modeled the pins in Rhino, did some test prints, couldn't decide
        on which size pin I wanted to use, so I printed 2 sets of bowling pins (3h58 @ low quality). Now that I had new pins, I
        decided to rename my initial bowling pins (the rectangular blocks) as bowling blocks.</span>

        -Painted bowling pins.

        <br>
        <br>
        -Modeled and printed new large storage container to hold all parts.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: normal">I didn't need to model and print a new storage container
        since I could have just used the old one. However, the smaller storage container could only hold
            1 set of bowling pins/blocks, and I liked the bowling blocks so much that
        I wanted a storage container that fit all the parts I made (10h32 @ low quality).</span>

        <span style="font-weight: normal">Once the improvements were done, my final project was complete! If I had even more time to work, I would
        have made a mini bowling instructions pamphlet and decorated the outside of the box.</span>
