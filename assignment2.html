    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Assemble the 3D printer and get started with a few test prints!
    </p>

    <h2>Assembling the 3D Printer</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I got the
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://creality3d.shop/products/creality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer"
           style="color: deeppink">Creality Ender 3 Pro</a>
        for this class. While setting up the printer, I followed this
        <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ibsOYzXduYc"
           style="color: deeppink">walkthrough video</a>
        along with the directions that came with the printer. Assembly took around five hours to complete.
        While most of the assembly was done alone, there were a few steps of the process where I found another
        set of hands to be helpful. My build plate was initially really unstable, and I wanted to
        address that first. I followed several different Youtube videos to figure out how to fix this issue and
        recruited the help of my brother to hold some pieces in position as I adjusted the eccentric nuts below
        the build plate. Once the build plate was sturdy, the rest of the assembly was smooth sailing. After checking
        for loose screws, I made
        sure that the printer powered on when plugged in, and then I worked on leveling the build plate.
    </p>

    <h2>Leveling the Build Plate</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I followed this
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3235018"
           style="color: deeppink">bed leveling protocol</a> on Thingiverse. This
        <a target="_blank" style="color: deeppink" href="https://youtu.be/_EfWVUJjBdA">video</a>
        walked me through the protocol. I experienced confusion when my bed leveling process
        wasn't matching the process shown in the video. I found out that the files referred to
        in the video were not compatible with the Ender 3 Pro, and that I needed to use the 32-Bit
        M25 versions of the files provided on Thingiverse. This solved the issue I was experiencing,
        and I was able to level the bed plate successfully.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started with Test Prints</h2>
    <img src="A2-Getting-Started-With-3D-Printing/images/test_prints.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Finally, I was able to get started on some test prints! In the table below, I've documented the
        test prints I did, along with the Cura settings applied, expected printing time, actual time
        and dimensions, and their STL and G-Code files. Dimensions were measured with calipers.
