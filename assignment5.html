    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Finish the lamp and get started on making molds!
    </p>

    <h2>Preparing Materials</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Last week, I decided on 3D printing a frame for my lamp that would hold 4 mirror film lined
        polycarbonate sheets. After getting my materials, I had to prepare them for assembly. I cut
        the polycarbonate sheets to size and then lined all sheets with mirror film.

    <h2>Modeling the Lamp</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        After the sheets were prepped, I used a ruler and my caliper to get the exact dimensions of the
        sheets which would help me define the size of the slots in the 3D-printed frame. I began modeling
        the frame in Rhino, starting with the slots that would hold the sheets. Before proceeding with the
        rest of the model, I wanted to make sure that all the sheets would fit into the slot when printed.
        Therefore, I printed a section of the slot to test if all 4 sheets could slide in.
    </p>
    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/slotSection.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/mirrorFit.jpg" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        All 4 sheets fit into the slot! The slot could be slightly smaller so I made this adjustment in Rhino. I
        then worked on modeling the remaining structure of the lamp's frame!
    </p>
    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/initial_lamp.PNG" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once I got to this point in my modeling, I wanted to put it into Cura to see how long the print would take. I
        still haven't added the internal pieces that would attach the frame to the light.
    </p>
    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/lamp_cura.PNG" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once I put the frame into Cura, I was a bit shocked that it would take around 3 days to print
        (this isn't even the full model yet!!). I realized that I totally forgot about factoring in the time
        needed to print supports for the top section of the frame. Since I didn't want to spend 3 days
        printing the frame, I decided I needed to go with something simpler because of time.
    </p>
    <h2>Designing a New Lamp</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        For my second lamp idea, I wanted to do something smaller and that had a pattern on the outer edge. I sketched
        out a few ideas and then decided to go with a one-part shade that I could place over the light. I recently got
        some transparent PLA that I wanted to try, so this design worked out well.
    </p>
    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/newIdea.jpg" width="80%">

    <h2>Modeling the New Lamp</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        To model the new lamp, I began by drawing the outer edge pattern and then used polar array to repeat that for the
        full 360 degrees. After offsetting and extruding the lamp, I placed it into Cura where I found some edge errors with
        the model that would greatly impact the print. I had to go back into Rhino and do some troubleshooting. Junchao
        was able to help me identify where the issue was and taught me how to avoid the same issue in the future. With Junchao's help
        I was able to finish the modeling of the lamp on my own, add the internal components that would attach the shade to the light,
        slice it in Cura, and send it to the printer! Better than my first lamp idea, this model would only take 31 hours to print
        (it actually ended up being 29 hours! yay!)!
    </p>

    <img src="A5-Lamp/images/rhino_open.PNG" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        In the first hour of printing, I wanted to put what Junchao taught me into
        practice, so I worked on modeling a third lamp idea! Modeling the third idea was so much faster, and I didn't
        run into any major issues that I couldn't figure out on my own! I'm excited to print this other shade later.

        The lamp shade printed in 29 hours!

    <p style="width: 80%">
        After printing the lampshade, I placed it over the light! I'm very happy with the end result, and I'm hoping
        to install it over my desk.

    <h2>Making the Mold</h2>
    <img src="A5-Mold/images/kirby.jpg" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The goal is to 3D print the molds for my 2-part silicone molds! For my master part, I wanted to
        create molds to produce a bunch of Kirbys. I found STL files of
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1913526"
           style="color: deeppink">Kirby</a>
        on Thingiverse! I put Kirby into Rhino, reduced the mesh, scaled it down, and used DraftAngleAnalysis
        to identify where I should split the mold in half (to create a 2-part silicone mold).
    </p>
    <img src="A5-Mold/images/kirby_full.PNG" width="80%">
    <img src="A5-Mold/images/scaryKirby.PNG" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I call this Scary Kirby.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I split the mesh, created polysurfaces using NURBS, and worked on modeling the molds for my silicone molds.
        I made sure to add keys so that the silicone molds wouldn't shift too much and added pipes to create a funnel for
        pouring and tunnels for air to escape.
    </p>

    <h2>Printing the Molds</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I sliced the models in Cura and printed them! It was an 11-hour print. The bottom of one of the parts warped so I
        reprinted it. Overall, they look pretty good!
    </p>

    <img src="A5-Mold/images/reprint.jpg" width="80%">
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I reprinted the mold for Kirby's bottom half since the first print was warped. The second print turned out well!

        A HUGE shoutout and thank you to Junchao for guiding me this week when I was puzzled
        about edge issues and messy lines in Rhino while modeling my second lamp idea and also
        for teaching me some Rhino commands that
        really helped me when designing my Kirby molds. Thank you Junchao !!
